        <h2 class="hloan">Home Loan</h2>
        <img  class=img src="./image/ Loan.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;">
        <p>A home loan, also known as a mortgage, is a type of financial product that allows individuals to 
            purchase or refinance a residential property. Home loans are typically secured loans, with the
             property itself serving as collateral for the loan. Borrowers make a down payment and repay the
              loan amount over a specified term, often 15 to 30 years, along with interest. The interest rate 
              can be fixed or variable, and the terms and conditions of the loan vary depending on the lender
               and the borrower's creditworthiness. Home loans are a common way for people to realize their
                homeownership dreams and are available from banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders.<br><br>
<br>
                1.<b>Property Purchase or Refinance:</b> Home loans are used to finance the purchase of a residential property or to refinance an existing mortgage.<br>
<br>
                2.<b>Secured Loan:</b> Home loans are typically secured by the property itself, which serves as collateral. This means that if the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can take possession of the property through foreclosure.<br>
                <br>
                2.<b>Loan Amount: </b>The loan amount depends on the property's value and the borrower's financial situation. Borrowers often need to make a down payment, with the loan covering the remaining purchase price.<br>
                <br>
                4.<b>Interest Rate:</b> Home loans can have fixed or variable interest rates. Fixed-rate mortgages have consistent monthly payments, while variable-rate mortgages can fluctuate based on market interest rates.<br>
                <br>
                5.<b>Loan Term:</b> Home loans have specific terms, commonly ranging from 15 to 30 years. The term determines the duration over which the loan will be repaid.

        <h2 class="hloan">Business Loan</h2>
        <img  class=img src="./image/BUSINESS Loan.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;">
        <p>A business loan is a financial product designed to provide funding to businesses for various purposes,
             such as expansion, working capital, or equipment purchase. These loans can be secured or unsecured,
              and the terms and interest rates depend on factors like the business's creditworthiness and the lender's
               policies. Business loans often have specific repayment terms, which may include fixed monthly payments,
                and they can be used to support a wide range of business needs,
             from covering day-to-day expenses to funding growth initiatives.<br><br>
            
             <b>1.Purpose:</b> Business loans are typically designed to fund specific business needs, such as working capital, expansion, equipment purchase, inventory, or capital investment.<br>

             <b>2.Loan Amount:</b> The amount of the loan can vary widely, from small loans for startups to large amounts for established businesses. The loan amount is determined based on the business's financial health and the purpose of the loan.<br>
             
             <b>3.Secured or Unsecured:</b> Business loans can be secured, where collateral like assets or property is required, or unsecured, which doesn't require collateral but may have higher interest rates.<br>
             
             <b>4.Interest Rates:</b> Interest rates can be fixed or variable and depend on factors such as the lender, the creditworthiness of the business, and prevailing market rates.<br>
             
             <b>5.Repayment Terms:</b> Business loans have specific repayment terms, which can range from short-term loans (a few months) to long-term loans (several years). The repayment schedule may include monthly, quarterly, or annual installments.</p>
        
             <h2 class="hloan">Personal Loan</h2>
             <img class=img src="./image/PERSONALLoan.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;">
        <p>A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan that individuals can borrow from a financial institution
            , such as a bank, credit union, or online lender, for various personal expenses. Unlike secured
             loans, like auto loans or mortgages, personal loans do not require collateral, such as a car or a 
             house, to back the loan. Instead, lenders rely on the borrower's creditworthiness and ability to
              repay the loan based on their income and credit history.<br>

            Here are some key features and aspects of personal loans:
            
            <b>1. Unsecured Nature:</b> Personal loans are unsecured, meaning they are not backed by any collateral. This makes them accessible to a wider range of borrowers who may not have valuable assets to pledge as security.<br>
            
             <b>2.Loan Amount:</b> Personal loan amounts can vary widely, typically ranging from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the lender and the borrower's creditworthiness.<br>
            
            <b>3.Interest Rates:</b> The interest rates on personal loans can be fixed or variable and are determined by factors like the borrower's credit score, income, loan amount, and the lender's policies. Generally, borrowers with excellent credit histories receive lower interest rates.<br>
            
            <b>4.Repayment Terms:</b> Personal loans usually have fixed repayment terms, meaning you agree to repay the loan over a set period, often ranging from 1 to 5 years. Some lenders may offer shorter or longer terms.<br>
            
            <b>5.Monthly Payments: </b>Borrowers repay personal loans in equal monthly installments.</p>
             
             <h2 class="hloan">Vehicle Loan</h2>
             <img class=img src="./image/VEHICLE Loan.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 300px;">
             <p>Vehicle loans, also known as auto loans or car loans, are a type of financing designed to help individuals purchase vehicles. Here are the key features of vehicle loans:<br><br>

                <b>1.Purpose:</b> Vehicle loans are specifically intended to finance the purchase of automobiles, including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and sometimes recreational vehicles (RVs) or boats.<br>
                
                <b>2.Secured Loan:</b> Most vehicle loans are secured by the vehicle itself, which serves as collateral. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle.<br>
                
                <b>3.Loan Amount:</b> The loan amount is based on the cost of the vehicle minus any down payment made by the borrower. Some lenders may also finance taxes, registration fees, and other related costs.<br>
                
                <b>4.Interest Rate:</b> Vehicle loans can have fixed or variable interest rates. Fixed rates remain constant throughout the loan term, while variable rates may change based on market conditions.<br>
                
                <b>5.Loan Term:</b> Vehicle loan terms typically range from 36 to 72 months, though some lenders may offer longer terms. Shorter terms result in higher monthly payments but lower overall interest costs.<br>
